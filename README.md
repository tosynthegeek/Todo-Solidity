# Todo Application


In this contract, I built a Todo Application designed to function as a simple to-do list, where users can create tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them.

## Tools and Preriquisites

To build this application in development, I used the following dependencies:

Hardhat: 

Remix IDE

Metamask: Identity to interact with the Blockchain

Etherscan: Block explorer for verifying/exploring transactions and contracts on Ethereum

## Getting Started

To run this code locally, navigate into the directory of the project, then run:

`npm install --save-dev hardhat`

Initialize your Hardhat project by running:

`npx hardhat init`



## Running Tests

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npx hardhat test
```



## Deployment

We would be deploying to the Sepolia network as our environment was set up for it.
To deploy this project run

```bash
  npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia

```
